8 13:Hey yeah I'm gonna be quick, you can use levers "/"`by walking up to them and typing "use" and the direction it is, or by standing on it and pressing 'Space'! Try it on the lever below!`
6 14:If you're curious, every map and character you see in this game is generated from a text file and then loaded into the program.`If you want, you can throw an extra '#' somewhere on any map in the 'files/maps' folder and then reload the game to se these changes! There isn't any error catching for this, so please be sure to add it within the boundaries set. Otherwise, have a good day and have fun with the rest of this!`
1 6:Walk up to the 'C' and type 'talkto [direction]' to start talking to them. I've spent a lot of time trying to get this NPC dialogue/shop system to work. Hopefully, by time I have this sent out, I have the shop system working.`
