# TextToGameEngine

A winter break project to learn to handle a larger project while (attempting to) use design patterns to improve my ability to use them.

The program uses file readers to look at a file and, well, read it and look for specific information such as the map layout, messages to read, levers/pressure plates and the walls they toggle on/off, loot on the ground, and npc's in the room.
Along with this, it also reads in npc files and creates an interactable npc through commands.

It also includes a text-field reader that utilizes commands that can fully replace any button commands in the game, along with an inventory system, fully useable player movement on the map.


Please excuse (or enjoy) the current maps in place, I used this as both a learning experience and an assingment for an English class.
